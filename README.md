# OpenFaceCpp
C++ implementation for OpenFace library by CMU https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface. This is still a work in progress. 

We utilize all their dependencies: dlib, torch and OpenCV, besides a minimal testing library: UnitTect++. 

In order to install just run install.sh. For the resulting executable to run, you need to download models first from: and place it in same folder with executable.
